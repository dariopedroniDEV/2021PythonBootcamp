# String are ordered sequences. They can be indexed and sliced to grab individual parts.
# Indexing in Python starts at 0.

# Index positioning
#h e l l o
#0    1      2      3    4
#0   -4     -3     -2   -1
# REVERSE INDEXING if you want to grab the last character of a string

# SLICING to grab a part of a string that is more than one character
#[start:stop:step]

# Use double quotes instead of a single one, to avoid Python confusion.

#Special commands inside string.

#Escape sequence \n (bring text one word down using \n)
print('Hello \nworld')

#Escape sequence \t TAB (4 characters space)
print('Hello \tworld')

# len(value) to check how many characters are inside sentence.
lenTest = len('I am')
print('the lenght of I AM is:', lenTest)
